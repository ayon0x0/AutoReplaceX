# AutoReplaceX

**AutoReplaceX** is a Burp Suite extension designed to simplify the process of managing and replacing HTTP headers, cookies, and JWT tokens in HTTP requests. It provides a user-friendly interface for saving custom headers, cookies, and JWTs, and allows users to apply these modifications to requests sent to Burp's Repeater tool or directly within the message editor.

- **Message Editor Tab**: View and edit requests with automatic header replacement functionality.
- **Persistent Settings**: Save and load configurations (cookies, JWTs, and headers) using Burp's extension settings.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Easily apply stored headers to requests or update the extension with headers from intercepted requests.

## üöÄ Usage

### Configure Headers:
1. Navigate to the **AutoReplaceX** tab in Burp Suite.
2. Enter cookies in the **Cookies** field (e.g., `session=abc123`).
3. Enter JWT tokens in the **JWT Token** field (e.g., `eyJhb...`).
4. Add custom headers in the **Custom Headers** text area, one per line (e.g., `X-API-Key: mykey`).
5. Click **Save** to store the settings.

### Send Requests to Repeater:
1. In Burp's Proxy, Target, or other tools, right-click a request.
2. Select one of the following:
   - **Send to Repeater with Cookie Replacement**: Replaces the `Cookie` header with the saved cookie.
   - **Send to Repeater with JWT Replacement**: Replaces the `Authorization: Bearer` header with the saved JWT.
   - **Send to Repeater with Full Header Replacement**: Applies all custom headers from the **Custom Headers** field.
3. The modified request will appear in the **Repeater** tab.

### Extract Headers:
- Right-click a request and select:
  - **Send Cookie to Extension**: Copies the `Cookie` header to the extension's Cookies field.
  - **Send JWT Token to Extension**: Copies the `Authorization: Bearer` token to the JWT Token field.
  - **Send Headers to Extension**: Copies all headers (excluding `Host`, `GET`, and `POST`) to the Custom Headers field.
- Saved settings are automatically updated.

### Message Editor:
- When viewing a request in Burp's HTTP history or other tools, the **AutoReplaceX** tab displays the request with applied headers.
- If editable, modify the request directly in the tab.

## üìã Example

- Save a cookie (`session=xyz123`) and a custom header (`X-Custom: value`) in the **AutoReplaceX** tab.
- Right-click a request in the **Proxy** tab and select **Send to Repeater with Full Header Replacement**.
- In the **Repeater** tab, the request will include the saved cookie and custom header.

## üõ† Development

- **Language**: Python (Jython-compatible)
- **Dependencies**: Requires Burp Suite's Jython environment
- **Source**: The main logic is in `AutoReplaceX.py`, which implements Burp's `IBurpExtender`, `IMessageEditorTabFactory`, `IContextMenuFactory`, and `ITab` interfaces.

### To contribute:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Make changes to `AutoReplaceX.py`.
3. Test the extension in Burp Suite.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Requires manual configuration of headers in the UI.
- Ensure Jython is correctly set up for Burp Suite to avoid loading issues.
